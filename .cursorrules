# Cursor Rules

ALWAYS review and comply with `README.md` in the root directory. 

`README.md` is the single source of truth and entry point for:
- Project overview and structure
- Development standards
- Design guidelines (linked via `webSpecs.md`)
- AI usage policies

Do not make assumptions. Start by reading `README.md`.
