# Modern Craftsman Brand Voice - Copy Audit

**Status:** REVIEWED  
**Date:** January 17, 2026  
**Standard:** "Clear over clever, warm professionalism"

## Brand Voice Principles (from webSpecs.md)
1. **Clear over clever** - Information should be immediately accessible
2. **Warm professionalism** - Technical expertise delivered with humanity  
3. **Specific and concrete** - No vague promises
4. **Active and direct** - Avoid passive voice

## Page-by-Page Analysis

### ✅ Homepage (Home.tsx)
- **Hero:** "Enterprise Strategy. Small Business Soul." - ✅ Perfect brand voice
- **Tagline:** "IT, security, and brand growth for teams that think big" - ✅ Clear and direct
- **Service descriptions:** All follow "clear over clever" (e.g., "No downtime, just uptime")
- **Verdict:** Excellent consistency

### ✅ Managed IT (ManagedIT.tsx)
- Uses concrete language: "99.9% uptime", "24/7 monitoring"
- Avoids jargon without explanation
- **Verdict:** On-brand

### ✅ Brand Growth (Growth.tsx)
- Page title updated to "Brand Growth" (was "Americanization & Growth")
- Maintains warm professionalism
- **Verdict:** Consistent after naming fix

### ✅ Support (Support.tsx)
- Priority levels clearly explained (P1-P4 with response times)
- Warm tone: "Our team monitors tickets during business hours"
- **Verdict:** Professional but approachable

### ✅ Contact (Contact.tsx)
- Updated: "Select your inquiry type below and we'll match you with the right team"
- Removed overly formal "route your inquiry" language
- **Verdict:** Improved, now more conversational

### ⚠️ About (About.tsx) - NOT REVIEWED
- Recommendation: Verify uses "Built by engineers for businesses" tone
- Should avoid corporate speak

### ⚠️ Pricing (Pricing.tsx) - NOT REVIEWED
- Recommendation: Ensure pricing tiers use clear, concrete language
- Avoid "synergy" or marketing buzzwords

## Terminology Consistency Check

| Concept | ✅ Preferred | ❌ Avoid |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Service offering | "Managed IT" | "IT Support" |
| Marketing service | "Brand Growth" | "Brand & Marketing" |
| Client relationship | "Partnership" | "Vendor relationship" |
| Service quality | "Enterprise-grade" | "Industry-leading" |
| Response | "15-minute response" | "Rapid response" |
| Pricing | "$1,500/mo" | "Competitive pricing" |

## Common Issues AVOIDED ✅
- No "synergizing paradigms" corporate speak
- No "world-class" empty superlatives
- No passive voice ("is provided by" → "we provide")
- No jargon without explanation

## Tone Samples - GOOD Examples

✅ "Cloud-native infrastructure that just works. No downtime, just uptime."  
✅ "Your own CIO/CMO without the salary cap."  
✅ "Closing the home-office security gap."  
✅ "Enterprise Strategy. Small Business Soul."

## Tone Samples - AVOID

❌ "Leveraging best-in-class solutions to optimize your digital transformation journey"  
❌ "Synergizing cross-functional stakeholders for maximum ROI"  
❌ "Industry-leading, cutting-edge, next-generation platform"

## Recommendations

1. **Continue using:**
   - Concrete numbers (99.9%, 15-minute, $1,500/mo)
   - Active voice ("We monitor" not "Monitoring is provided")
   - Specific benefits ("No downtime" not "Reliable service")

2. **Audit remaining pages:**
   - About.tsx
   - Pricing.tsx
   - Resources.tsx

3. **Maintain consistency:**
   - All CTAs use "Let's Get Started" (not "Talk to Sales")
   - Service names standardized (Brand Growth, not Brand & Marketing)
   - Tone stays warm but professional throughout

---

**VERDICT:** ✅ Current copy demonstrates excellent adherence to Modern Craftsman brand voice. Main pages (Home, Services, Support, Contact) all pass brand consistency standards.
